Curent repository contains snippets I build based on my personal needs. I expect those to be cross-component snippets: Touchdesinger, Python and Arduino (R4 Wifi).

Since I want to reuse them in the future, I am sharing them here, which makes me to generalise the implementation. Hence, making them available for public use.

Feedback is appreciated either here, or via Instagram DM: @ilia.feelin.good.

## RGBLed

Goal of this implementation is to be able to stream TOP to an RGB LED Panel via Serial. [My panel](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003901833984.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.11.4db81802bIbykX) is a 16x16, WS2812B-powered snake-shaped strip. Implementation is based on [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED).
